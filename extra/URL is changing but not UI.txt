it relates to react-router-dom functionality , react-router-dom

has a match making pattern that dynamically compares two previous URL and 

current url , it does not consider route parameter

it does not compare FULL-URLs , so according to this article 

you must give router parameters with useParams()

and then give your router parameter to useEffect() second argument array

like this :

const { courseId } = useParams();


useEffect(() => {

}, [courseId]);


with this code , when router parameter changes , react will figure out 

that some change is occurred and your page will be re-rendered

problem solved !!!

and according to my programming way !!! in routes like this , 
please do not implement 'fetched' logic , it will cause the discussed problem !!
